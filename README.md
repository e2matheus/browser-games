# Browser Games

This repository contains browser games made while coding along with different video tutorials. It's goal is to provide a set of online games to try and to learn from. By browsing over it, developers should be able to better familiarize themselves with different languages like JavaScript, HTML5, C# (coding in [Unity][credits-unity]), and more.

## Agar.io

   * __Game concept:__ it's > "...a massively multiplayer online action game created by Brazilian developer Matheus Valadares. Players control one or more circular cells in a map representing a Petri dish. The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cells. Each player starts with one cell, but players can split a cell into two once it reaches a sufficient mass, allowing them to control multiple cells. The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria" (for further information, its [Wikipedia page][credits-wikipedia-agario].

### Credits ###

Browser Games was inspired by [Coding Train's Frogger coding challenge][credits-frogger-challenge], and its video tutorials, which contain a [p5.js][credits-p5-js] version of that game. It was also inspired by Olivine Labs' [Lua Style Guide][credits-lua-style], cocos2d's [cocos2d Javascript test and games][credits-cocos2d-games], and OneSignal's [Emoji Picker][credits-emoji-picker]. This version is focused on multiple web games.
